#####run_analysis.R

This file describes the transformations done 
on the original data set to generate the 
space delimited by file named _"AverageValues.txt"_ 
generated by the script _run_analysis.R_

####Steps:

1. READ ACTIVITY AND FEATURES 
* Read activity code and descriptions. 
* Relabel acitivity code and desctiption columns to user friend name (ActivityCode, Activity)
* Read features code and descriptions.  
* Relabel features code and desctiption columns to user friend name ( FeaturesCode, Features)

2. READ TEST DATA AND PREPARE DATA FRAME
* Read test data and and corresponding test activity codes and subject data files
* Put subject, test data and related activity code in the same data frame
* Relabel subject and acitivity code column to user friendly name
* Merge Activity Code descriptions with test data

3. READ TRAIN DATA AND PREPARE DATA FRAME
* Read train data and and corresponding train activity codes and subject data files
* Put subject, train data and related activity code in the same data frame
* Relabel subject and acitivity code column to user friendly name
* Merge Activity Code descriptions with train data

4. RELABELING AND SUBSETTING THE DATA FRAMES
* Relabel variable (V1 - V561) names to descriptive names for test and train data
* Select only columns realted to mean() and std() for test and train data


5. TRANSFORMATIONS
* Merge test and train data.
* compute the mean for each column grouping by Acitivy and Subject

6. CREATE TEXT FILE 
* Create txt file  _"AverageValues.txt"_
* First row contains the names of the variables
